# React Framework

ReactJS is a good library, and smart people are building clever modules.  
If you do the math, we are going to have a **great framework** out of this!

Here we'll collect the best modules and the best tutorials to compose this framework.

## Contribute!

This is an early project so we keep things very simple:

- fork the [sources repo](https://github.com/react-framework/gitbook-sources)
- branch out your contribution
- submit a _pull request_

All the sources are simple [_Markdown_](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files which we assembly in a static web site using [_GitBook_](https://www.gitbook.com).
